# Change-Previous-Author
Simple script to change your previous email/name on old commits and set them as your current identity.

### Why
If you realised you used a wrong email in your previous commits, such as your personal email, leaking your identity, or an email that doesn't associate to your Github accounts so you don't get the commits on your Github account, well then this is the solution for any of those issues or similar ones.

For the original concept, this script is meant to make the progress fully automatic besides configuration.
